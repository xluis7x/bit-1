## SneakX

This project is about Sneakers. SneakX is a website where your sneakers dreams could become a reality. A trade, sell and buy website for sneakers of every kind, brand and whatever you are looking for, only sneakers. 
I would like to make it Dynamic, include a Logo, create a personal brand. 

I will use everything I've learn about HTML, CSS and star with Java stuff, it'll make my website even better. Also I would like to make useful, website will have useful buttons, a shopping cart, payment methods and support help. 

Maybe in the future I could use this website to start a new bussiness, sneakers community is big enough to create a new brand or project.
